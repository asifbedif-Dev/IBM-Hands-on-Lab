## GitHub Overview
First, let's introduce you to GitHub. GitHub is a collection of folders and files. It is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. Git is a command-line tool. It hosts and maintains a server via command line. 
GitHub provides this Git server and a Web-based graphical interface for you. It also provides access control and collaboration features, such as wikis and basic task management tools for every project. 
In addition, GitHub provides cloud storage for source code, supports all popular programming languages, and streamlines the iteration process. GitHub includes a free plan for individual developers and hosting Open Source projects.
